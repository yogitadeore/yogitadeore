##Hey 👋, I'm [Yogita!]

Hi, I'm Yogita Deore, a Front-end Developer and a bit of full-stack developer.🚀 from India, currently, I'm a Web developer at 🙍🏽‍♂️ @Sri Adiyoga Institute Nashik. I mostly work on React-related technologies for building user-friendly Frontends that keep user interaction and accessibility at the highest. Apart from that I have a fairly good grip on backend technologies like Node, Express and MongoDB.
